I. Written test 
*Please explain in your on words
1. What is a JavaScript Framework and explain about Vue.js as one of the JavaScript Framework! 
A JavaScript framework is a pre-written code in the form of a library that provides a structure 
for developers to build web applications. Its often include tools, utilities, and conventions that 
help streamline the development process, to making it more efficient and organized. 
Vue.js is an open source (Javascript) framework that is designed to simplify the process of 
building interactive web interfaces. It was created by Evan You and first released in 2014. 
Vue.js is really recommend for both beginners and experienced developers.


2. What is the use of ellipsis?
The ellipsis ( ... ), is a punctuation mark that serves various purposes in different contexts. 
In the context of programming, the ellipsis (...) has different meanings depending on the 
programming language and its usage. 
-In JavaScript, elilipsis can be used to define variadic parameters, allowing a function to accept 
an arbitrary number of arguments, can be used as a placeholder to indicate a part of the code 
that should be filled or implemented further, especially within functions using async/await, 
and can be used as the object spread operator to extract properties from an object or array.
-In Phyton , ellipsis can be used to define variadic parameters, allowing a function to accept 
an arbitrary number of arguments, can be used as a placeholder to indicate that a part of the 
code is not displayed, especially when importing specific functions or modules from a 
package.
- In Java, ellipsis can be used to define variadic parameters, allowing a function to accept an 
arbitrary number of arguments.


3. Explain animation properties below: 
a. @keyframe : A set of styles for a CSS animation. It allows to specify the CSS styles at 
different points in the animation sequence. The animation will gradually change from the 
style at the beginning of the keyframe to the style at the end.
b. animation-name : is a CSS property that specifies the name of the keyframes rule to be 
used. It associates an element with a particular set of keyframes defined using keyframes. 
This property is used to reference the animation sequence you want to apply to an 
element.
c. animation-duration : The length of time for one cycle of the animation. It defines the total 
duration of the animation in seconds or milliseconds. This property determines how long 
it takes for the animation to complete one iteration.
d. animation-iteration : is a CSS property that specifies the number of times an animation 
cycle should be played. It can take a specific number of iterations or values such as infinite 
to make the animation repeat indefinitely.
e. animation-direction : s a CSS property that determines whether the animation should play 
in the normal direction, in reverse, or alternate between normal and reverse on each 
cycle. It controls the direction in which the animation progresses.


4. Please explain how lazy load works in JavaScript! 
Lazy loading in JavaScript is a technique used to defer the loading of certain resources (such 
as images, scripts, or styles) until they are actually needed. Lazy loading is particularly 
beneficial for websites with a large amount of media content. This can improve the initial 
loading time of a webpage by loading only the essential content first and deferring the loading 
of non-essential content until it is required. 
First , we use the src attribute of certain elements in HTML, such as images or iframes, is set 
to a placeholder or a small-sized version of the content rather than the actual resource, and 
then JavaScript to detect when an element comes into the viewport or is about to be displayed 
on the screen, When an element becomes visible in the viewport, the data-src attribute is 
used to set the actual source (src) of the element. This triggers the browser to fetch and load 
the actual resource. Last, The Intersection Observer keeps track of the visibility state of each 
observed element and invokes a callback when an element crosses the threshold into or out 
of the viewport.


5. Mention at least 5 git commands and describe each function of them! 
- git init: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.
- git clone: Creates a copy of a remote Git repository on your local machine.
- git add: Adds changes in the working directory to the staging area.
- git commit: Records changes to the repository with a commit message.
- git pull: Fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them into the current branch
